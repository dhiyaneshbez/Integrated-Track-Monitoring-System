# ITMS - Integrated Track Monitoring System

A comprehensive railway track monitoring system that uses YOLOv8 object detection to identify and classify track defects in real-time, paired with a modern React-based dashboard for visualization and management.

## 🚂 Overview

ITMS combines computer vision and web technologies to provide an automated solution for railway track inspection and monitoring. The system detects 15 different types of track defects and anomalies, helping maintain railway safety and reduce manual inspection efforts.

## 🎯 Features

### AI-Powered Detection
- **15 Defect Classes**: Detects cracks, flakings, joints, shellings, spallings, squats, ballast loss, broken fishplates, corrosion, loose bolts, missing bolts, rail joint gaps, rail wear, sleeper cracks, and surface spalling
- **YOLOv8 Model**: State-of-the-art object detection with high accuracy
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast inference for live monitoring

### Web Dashboard
- **Live View**: Real-time video feed with detection overlays
- **Detection Management**: View, filter, and manage detected defects
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize trends and statistics
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- **Device Management**: Monitor and configure detection devices
- **Task Assignment**: Create and track maintenance tasks
- **Report Generation**: Export detection reports

## 📊 Training the Model

### Dataset Structure
Organize your dataset as follows:
```
ITMS/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
├── valid/
│   ├── images/
│   └── labels/
└── test/
    ├── images/
    └── labels/
```

### Configuration
Edit `data.yaml` to match your dataset paths and classes.

### Train the Model
```bash
python train_yolo.py
```

**Training Parameters:**
- Model: YOLOv8s
- Epochs: 80
- Image Size: 640x640
